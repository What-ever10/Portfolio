            <p>
              I'm a passionate full-stack developer with expertise in building
              modern web applications. With a strong foundation in JavaScript
              and its ecosystems, I create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey in web development began 3 years ago, and since then
              I've worked on various projects ranging from small business websites
              to complex web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
              contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying outdoor activities.
            </p>
